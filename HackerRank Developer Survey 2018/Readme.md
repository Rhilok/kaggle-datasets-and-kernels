	We at [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) are passionate about ensuring that developers and companies can find each other and that the best matches are made. Our platforms, for the community and recruiting, are built to create the best experience for all involved.

We have over the years built a very strong global community of developers. In order to provide more transparency for ourselves and the world on the state of developers, we conducted a survey of our developers late in 2016. We got an astounding 25K responses! The survey asked developers many questions around their skills, educational background, current role, and more. We provided a high-level report of our findings from this survey earlier this year

## Data set Description
	The data consists of five files,HackerRank-Developer-Survey-2018-Values.csv: a CSV file with the text version of the survey responses. Each row is one respondent, including an anonymous respondent id, the timestamp of when the survey was started and ended, and the textual response to each question. This file was derived from HackerRank-Developer-Survey-2018-Numeric.csv using the mapping files that are included in this data set. We provide it for ease of use for those who prefer to work directly with the text values. A total of 25,090 professional and student developers completed our 10-minute online survey.
