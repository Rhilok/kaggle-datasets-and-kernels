Zillow's Economic Research Team collects, cleans and publishes housing and economic data from a variety of public and proprietary sources. Public property record data filed with local municipalities -- including deeds, property facts, parcel information and transactional histories -- forms the backbone of our data products, and is fleshed out with proprietary data derived from property listings and user behavior on Zillow.

In this kernel plotly library is used to visualize time series data. The range selector in plolty package is fantastic, it will alow to zoom data based on month,year ect. The Sqaurify library is used to visualize state vise real estate price. The missingno is nice package for visualize missing value in data set.
